# Food Ordering System using doubling link list 

1. PREREQUISITES <br />
<ul>
  <li>A good understanding of Data Structures as a whole, where to use arrays, where to use
    structures to compile a group of data etc.</li>
  <li>To be able to quickly solve coding problems </li>
  <li>Hardware that is good enough to run the system in an efficient manner and software that
    is able to run the code etc.</li>
  <br />
2. AIMS OF PROJECT
  <li>To develop a system that will surely satisfied the customer service.</li>
<li> To develop a system that would be usable by the user, to not be over efficient in any way,
it will be a system that promotes comfort from the user’s side so that when the user uses
  the system, it would be convenient for him to place orders etc.</li>
<li>To increase accuracy of the typical ordering systems that we have nowadays by using
  better technologies.</li>
<li>To improve the communication between the client and the server and minimize the time of
  ordering.</li>
  
  <li>Increase efficiency through detail reporting.</li>
<li> To automatically compute the bill through equations that involve multiplication, addition,
subtraction etc with respect to the quantities of food that are ordered. </li>
<li>The system will consist of two main subsystems: administration system and user system.</li>
<ul>
  <b>THE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM PROVIDES</b>
  <li> Admin can view all the informationn about the user</li>
  <li>Admin can ADD, DELETE, SEARCH and UPDATE the orders.</li>
  <li>Admin can ADD, DELETE, SEARCH and UPDATE the information about customer.</li>
  <li>Admin can approve or decline the order.</li>
</ul>

<ul> 
  <b>THE USER SYSTEM</b>
  <li> Register. </li>
  <li>View Menu.</li>
  <li>Place order</li>
<li>Every time a food is ordered, the order appears in the administration system so
  that the administrator confirms the order.</li>
  <li>When a food is ordered, user will receive an invoice</li>
  <li>The invoice would give details about the price of the order</li>
<li>When the user confirms the order, the admin then conforms it, afterwards, the
  user will get the estimated time of arrival of the food that he or she has ordered</li>
<li>Also, the user would also receive the order’s ID number, he/she would use this to
inquire about his/her order if there are any delays in the arrival of the order, for
  example.</li>
</ul>
  <br />
  3. CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE PROJECT
  <li> Maintaining and developing the app using data structures approach.</li>
  <li>Techniques for showing statistics of the food that has been ordered, the number of orders etc.</li>
  <li> Techniques for displaying the rating of the particular restaurant by calculating the average for the many users that have ordered from there before</li>
</ul>
